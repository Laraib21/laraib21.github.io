    <h1>Collection and Use of Personal Information</h1>
    <p>Personal information is data that can be used to identify or contact a single person.</p>
    <p>At no time does the application ask for personally identifiable information. All information added to the app is contained solely on the device.</p>

    <h1>What personal information we collect</h1>
    <p>When you create an event in the calendar, the events are stored locally on your device and are not shared outside of the application's secure sandbox. To remove the information, either delete the event or the entire app as necessary.</p>

    <h1>Collection and Use of Non-Personal Information</h1>
    <p>When you create an event, create or receive announcements or scan your student ID they are all stored locally on your device and are not shared outside of the application's secure sandbox. To remove the information, either delete the event/the student ID or the entire app as necessary.</p>

    <h1>Disclosure to Third Parties</h1>
    <p>At no point is the app’s information or user information ever shared outside of the application's secure sandbox</p>

    <h1>Others</h1>
    <p>It may be necessary − by law, legal process, litigation, and/or requests from public and governmental authorities within or outside your country of residence − for Apple to disclose your personal information. We may also disclose information about you if we determine that for purposes of national security, law enforcement, or other issues of public importance, disclosure is necessary or appropriate.</p>

    <h1>Protection of Personal Information</h1>
    <p>The security of your personal information is a very serious matter. To that end, the application has been structured to eliminate the sharing of personal information outside of the secure sandbox.</p>
